# Zomato Restaurant Data Analysis

## Project Overview
This project performs **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** on a Zomato restaurant dataset to understand restaurant distribution, cuisine trends, customer ratings, pricing behavior, and online delivery availability across multiple countries. The objective is to extract meaningful insights from raw data using Python-based data analysis and visualization techniques.

---

## Dataset
The dataset contains restaurant-level information including:
- Country codes and locations
- Cuisines offered
- Aggregate ratings and votes
- Price range
- Online delivery availability
- Customer rating metrics

The data spans **multiple countries**, enabling geographic and comparative analysis.

---

## Tools & Technologies
- **Python**
- **Pandas** – Data manipulation and preprocessing  
- **NumPy** – Numerical operations  
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – Data visualization  
- **Scikit-learn** – Encoding categorical variables  

---

## Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
- Cleaned and standardized column names
- Handled missing values in cuisine data
- Mapped country codes to country names for better interpretability
- Removed duplicate records
- Encoded categorical variables using label encoding and one-hot encoding
- Prepared the dataset for exploratory analysis

---

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
The following analyses were performed:
- Restaurant distribution by country
- Online delivery availability across countries
- Top cuisines based on restaurant count
- Aggregate rating distribution
- Relationship between price range and customer ratings
- Statistical analysis including skewness and kurtosis of numeric features

---

## Key Insights
- Identified countries with the highest concentration of restaurants
- Observed variation in online delivery adoption across regions
- Highlighted the most popular cuisines globally
- Analyzed customer rating distribution patterns
- Examined how pricing levels relate to restaurant ratings

---

## Outcome
This project demonstrates the use of **Python-based exploratory data analysis** to uncover patterns and trends in real-world restaurant data, supporting data-driven understanding of customer behavior and market characteristics.
